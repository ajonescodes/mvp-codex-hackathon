Hi Prime Estates LLC Team,

I wanted to share a few proactive ideas based on your recent transaction activity. We are seeing signals that suggest it may be a good time to tighten liquidity visibility and evaluate FX risk management tools. Our team can help you optimize cash positioning while reducing exposure from cross-currency activity.

If it would be helpful, I can arrange a short working session to review your cash flow cadence and discuss whether a sweep structure and/or forward contracts could add value right now.

Best regards,
Senior Banking Advisor
